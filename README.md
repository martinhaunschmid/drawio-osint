# draw.io Library for OSINT Investigations / Recon / Pentesting based on FontAwesome

I wasn't happy with Maltego or the default libraries for draw.io (the FontAwesome Libraries you find either include every icon to a certain point, or are just icons you cannot connect to other items in the graph). So I decided to create my own library with just a few icons I needed for my research.

This is far from complete, so feel free to extend this as you like.

# How to use

1. download the osint.xml
2. use it as library in draw.io

# In this Repo

1. `osint.xml`: the complete library, ready for use in draw.io
2. `icons_to_xml.sh`: quick and dirty script to regenerate the xml based on the icons in the `svg` folder
